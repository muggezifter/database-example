A small demo project I wrote as part of a job application.

It connects to a Wordpress database and shows a clickable list of users. If you click on a user it fetches and shows a list of 
the posts of that user. If you click on a post it fetches and shows the details of the post. 

It uses the Eloquent ORM, Mustache templates (on both the server and the client) and the Foundation CSS framework.
